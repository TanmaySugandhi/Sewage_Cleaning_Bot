#Sewage Cleaning Bot

This is the project titled 'Sewage Cleaning Bot' by T. Hima Avinash, Manichand, R.N. Rohit Chand, Tanmay Sugandhi. This is a record of the project work carried out by us during the year 2023-2024 as part of POST INDUCTION under the guidance and supervision of Mr. Murgan Saravanan (Technical Head) and Mr. N.V.V.S. Narayana (The President of THE ROBOTICS CLUB).

Abstract

Sewage cleaning is a dangerous and time-consuming task that poses significant health risks to human workers. The environment contains hazardous gases and materials, making manual cleaning inefficient and unsafe. Our Sewage Cleaning Bot is designed to address these issues by providing a safer, automated, and efficient method for cleaning and monitoring sewage pipelines. The bot is equipped with ESP8266, DC motors with a tank movement mechanism, a high-torque motor with a rack and pinion system, and real-time video streaming via ESP32-CAM. Additionally, the bot features an MQ-4 gas sensor to detect harmful gases and ensures that cleaning tasks are monitored remotely through a mobile application.

Introduction

With the increasing demand for sanitation and cleanliness, the use of robotics in sewage maintenance has become crucial. Our project aims to develop a robotic system capable of cleaning sewage lines efficiently while ensuring worker safety. The Sewage Cleaning Bot operates remotely, providing real-time feedback through a mobile application, enabling users to monitor and control the bot effortlessly.

Problem Statement

Manual sewage cleaning is hazardous due to exposure to toxic gases and unhygienic conditions. The current cleaning methods are labor-intensive, inefficient, and pose significant health risks. Our Sewage Cleaning Bot eliminates these challenges by providing an automated solution that reduces human intervention while improving the efficiency and safety of the cleaning process.

Features

Automated Cleaning Mechanism: Equipped with a high-torque motor and rack-pinion system to perform effective cleaning.

Remote Operation: Controlled via Wi-Fi using ESP8266, with a mobile application for real-time monitoring.

Tank Movement Mechanism: Geared DC motors enable movement in sewage environments.

Real-Time Video Streaming: Integrated ESP32-CAM for continuous monitoring and navigation.

Gas Detection System: MQ-4 gas sensor to detect harmful gases and notify the operator.

Working Principle

The bot is placed into the sewage pipeline.

The ESP8266 microcontroller activates and connects to the mobile application.

The motors drive the bot forward, navigating through the terrain.

The cleaning arm (rack-pinion mechanism) removes debris and blockages.

The ESP32-CAM streams real-time video to the mobile app for monitoring.

If harmful gases are detected, an alert is sent to the operator.

The user controls movement and operations remotely using the mobile app.
