# Sewage_Cleaning_Bot

This is the project titled *'Sewage Cleaning Bot'* by *T. Hima Avinash, Manichand, R.N. Rohit Chand, Tanmay Sugandhi*. 
This is a record of the project work carried out by us during the year *2023-2024* as part of *POST INDUCTION* under the guidance and supervision of *Mr. Murgan Saravanan (Technical Head)* and *Mr. N.V.V.S. Narayana (The President of THE ROBOTICS CLUB)*.

## Abstract
Sewage cleaning is a dangerous and time-consuming task that poses significant health risks to human workers. The environment contains hazardous gases and materials, making manual cleaning inefficient and unsafe. Our **Sewage Cleaning Bot** is designed to address these issues by providing a safer, automated, and efficient method for cleaning and monitoring sewage pipelines. The bot is equipped with **ESP8266**, **DC motors with a tank movement mechanism**, a **high-torque motor with a rack and pinion system**, and **real-time video streaming via ESP32-CAM**. Additionally, the bot features an **MQ-4 gas sensor** to detect harmful gases and ensures that cleaning tasks are monitored remotely through a **mobile application**.

## Introduction
With the increasing demand for sanitation and cleanliness, the use of robotics in sewage maintenance has become crucial. Our project aims to develop a robotic system capable of cleaning sewage lines efficiently while ensuring worker safety. The **Sewage Cleaning Bot** operates remotely, providing real-time feedback through a mobile application, enabling users to monitor and control the bot effortlessly.

## Problem Statement
Manual sewage cleaning is hazardous due to exposure to toxic gases and unhygienic conditions. The current cleaning methods are labor-intensive, inefficient, and pose significant health risks. Our **Sewage Cleaning Bot** eliminates these challenges by providing an automated solution that reduces human intervention while improving the efficiency and safety of the cleaning process.

## Features
- **Automated Cleaning Mechanism:** Equipped with a **high-torque motor and rack-pinion system** to perform effective cleaning.
- **Remote Operation:** Controlled via **Wi-Fi using ESP8266**, with a **mobile application** for real-time monitoring.
- **Tank Movement Mechanism:** **Geared DC motors** enable movement in sewage environments.
- **Real-Time Video Streaming:** Integrated **ESP32-CAM** for continuous monitoring and navigation.
- **Gas Detection System:** **MQ-4 gas sensor** to detect harmful gases and notify the operator.

## Working
    i. The bot is placed into the sewage pipeline.
    ii. The **ESP8266 microcontroller** activates and connects to the mobile application.
    iii. The **motors drive the bot forward**, navigating through the terrain.
    iv. The **cleaning arm (rack-pinion mechanism) removes debris and blockages**.
    v. The **ESP32-CAM streams real-time video** to the mobile app for monitoring.
    vi. If **harmful gases** are detected, an **alert is sent to the operator**.
    vii. The **user controls movement and operations remotely** using the mobile app.
